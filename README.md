# Readability Redux

```
Give your browsing an edge! Readability is a tool designed by Arc90.
In their words:
    "Readability is a simple tool that makes reading on the Web more
     enjoyable by removing the cluter around what you're reading."

Readability Redux is an extension for Google Chrome that brings you
the support for Arc90's Readability. Check it out yourself.

Since both the [original](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability) readability and the 
[original](https://github.com/MHordecki/readability-redux) readability redux were abandoned, this version aims to 
bring the same feature set to chrome but based on [mozillas readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) which 
is based on the original readability and powers the firefox reader mode.
